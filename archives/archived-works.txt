								    <h4 class="title">Overview</h4>
								    <p>T.A.G. (Technology and Gaming) Labs is a D.C. based nonprofit launched in 2013 by technology professionals with a passion for teaching young people coding and other S.T.E.A.M. related skills through the building of interactive gaming experiences.</p>
									  <h4 class="title">My Role</h4>
									  <p>I have been an intern at T.A.G. Labs since March 2017. Together with the Web Design/Development team, I have been working on the T.A.G. Labs website.</p>
									  <p>My usual tasks include adding new content to the website, which range across various forms such as interactive graphics and webpages.</p>
									  <p>While working on the website, I follow two main objectives:</p>
									  	<ul>
									  		<li><p>To make the T.A.G. Labs website engaging to students and potential sponsors.</p></li>
									  		<li><p>To keep the styles of the newly added content consistent with the original web theme in particular and with the T.A.G. Labs brand identity in general.</p></li>
									  	</ul>
