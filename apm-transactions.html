					<h2 class="title mt-5 mb-4">The Challenge</h2>
					
					<p>AppFolio, a leading platform for property management, empowers property managers to efficiently oversee their properties. As part of its suite, the Owner Portal allows property owners to access crucial insights into their properties. Over time, we - the owner experience team, has noticed a growing need from owners to have more visibility into transactions throughout the month, not just at the end of the month when property managers usually send out owner statements. This prompted us to embark on a journey to deliver this experience.

					<h2 class="title mb-4">Defining the Problem</h2>
					
					<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Feedback Analysis</h4>
					<p>In response to user feedback indicating a desire for more detailed transaction information, we conducted in-depth analysis of user feedback collected between September and November 2023. This revealed recurring themes highlighting the necessity for enhanced transaction visibility.</p>

					<div class="row ux-img">
					<div class="col-12 mb-lg-4">
						<img src="photos/uiux/apm/feedback-chart.png">
						
					</div>
				<div class="col-12 mb-lg-4"><img src="photos/uiux/apm/feedback-themes.png"></div></div>

					<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Discovery Calls</h4>
					<p>With what we knew from the feedback analysis, we reached out to users who provided the feedback, including both property managers and owners. We conducted <b>3 calls with property managers and 3 with owners</b> to further explore user needs and validate our initial assumptions.</p>
					<p>These discussions helped reinforce many themes identified through user feedback in the initial data gathering step, and enhanced our understanding of the problem. After synthesizing the call notes, we were able to identify the following key goals for our project:

</p>

					<ul>
						<li><p>Owners sought detailed transaction insights throughout the month, akin to end-of-month owner statements.</p></li>
						<li><p>Owners desired clarity on available funds per property to make informed financial decisions.</p></li>
						<li><p>Property managers required flexibility in tailoring information visibility for different owners.</p></li>
					</ul>

					
					<h2 class="title mt-5 mb-4">Ideation</h2>

					<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Mapping Relationships</h4>
					<p>Since one of the central themes from our discovery was the desire to view more details for expenses, our team first started ideation by focusing on the relationship among bills, payments, and line items within the AppFolio system. These are all concepts under the payables realm, each referring to a level of detail and/or status. We mapped out the relationships among these items and brainstormed opportunities for each part of this map. At the end of this process, we made the decision to present transactions at the <b>line item level</b> to provide an in-depth breakdown of information. This was also one of the more technically efficient approaches, considering the time and resource constraints we had at the time.</p>

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>We also explored the similarities and distinctions between the Transactions page and the existing Owner Statement report routinely distributed by property managers to owners at month-end. The consensus underscored our commitment to aligning the numerical data with that presented in the Owner Statement. Simultaneously, we aimed to enhance the Transactions page by offering a deeper level of detail and accessibility, enabling owners to select specific properties and timeframes for analysis.
</p>

					<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Iterating Through Solutions</h4>

					
					<p> I started with a few sketches to visualize our vision for the new portal. The early ideas closely resembled the Owner Statement with more elaborated interactions that enable details viewing and filters. I reviewed the sketches regularly with my team to discuss ideas and open questions. This process helped us identify and prioritize the most important functionalities of this page.
</p>

					<div class="row ux-img">

				  		<div class="mb-lg-4 col-md-6"><img src="photos/uiux/apm/lofi-expandable.png"></div>
					</div>

					<p>After several renditions, we settled on 2 to-be-validated variants for the detailed Transactions page: one with a combined section detailing all types of transactions and one with separate sections for different types. At the time, we were not sure which version matched users' mental model more </p>

					<div class="row ux-img">
				  		<div class="mb-lg-4 col-md-8 col-lg-9"><img src="photos/uiux/apm/variant-separate-blocks.png"></div>
						<div class="pt-2 pt-md-3 mb-lg-4 col-md-4 col-lg-3"><p class="figure-caption">In the separate variant, transaction types are broken down into 3 main sections: disbursement & contribution (owners' money coming in and out of the properties), unpaid bills, and income & expenses.</p>
						
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="row ux-img">
				  		<div class="mb-lg-4 col-md-8 col-lg-9"><img src="photos/uiux/apm/variant-combined.png"></div>
						<div class="pt-2 pt-md-3 mb-lg-4 col-md-4 col-lg-3"><p class="figure-caption">In the combined variant, unpaid bills are displayed in a greyed-out section on top, similar to pending transactions in banking apps. The idea here is to help owners picture everything in accordance with the running balance and connect that to the future.</p>
						
						</div>
					</div>

				</div></div>

				<div class="row justify-content-center">
					<div class="col-lg-10"><div class="works-caption">
					<h2 class="title mt-5 mb-4">Validation</h2>
					
					<p>In order to validate our approach and compare the two variants, we conducted <b>5 interviews</b> with property owners to assess the design solutions. Our primary objectives included determining:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><p>The preference for either variant among users.</p></li>
						<li><p>Whether the level of detail instilled confidence in users regarding their financial oversight.</p></li>
						<li><p>The coherence and effectiveness of the language employed in our approach.</p></li>
					</ul>

					<p>We had users walk through each variant, in alternating orders between participants, and ask questions to gauge users' thoughts throughout the process. These sessions helped us figure out the following preferences and expectations from users:
						
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li><p>Most users preferred the combined table for the connected info and running balance. However, unpaid bills is generally perceived as a separate total, as they are concerned about upcoming charges.</p></li>
						<li><p>Bill attachments would be a valuable addition for payment entries.</p></li>
						<li><p>Owners would like to tie the transactions to their owner statement, so things have to match the statements closely.</p></li>
					</ul>


					<h2 class="title mt-5 mb-4">Final Design</h2>


					<p>Incorporating user feedback from the validation process, we arrived at the final design for the new Transactions page:</p>

					<h5 class="sub-title-2 mt-5 mb-4">Filters</h5>

					<p>Property and date filters enable users to view a holistic overview or drill down into specific properties and timeframes.</p>

						<div class="pt-2 pt-md-3 mb-lg-4 col-md-4 col-lg-3"><p class="figure-caption">They would then be prompted to name the exported dataframe, and see it appear on the left navbar.</p>

						<div class="pt-2 mb-lg-4 col-12"><p class="figure-caption">Clicking on the dataframe name in the navbar opens the dataframe view, which offers 3 tabs: data, fields, and source.

					<h5 class="sub-title-2 mt-3">Summary</h5>
					<p class="pt-0 works-caption">The Summary section provides a snapshot of net property funds, aiding quick financial assessments.</p>
					<div class="row ux-img">
						<div class="pt-2 pt-md-3 mb-lg-4 col-md-4 col-lg-3"><p class="figure-caption">The Summary includes totals from transaction types, leading up to a current net property fund, letting owners know the available amount on their properties.</p></div>

					</div>

					<h5 class="sub-title-2 mt-5">Unpaid Bills</h5>
					<p class="pt-0 works-caption">This section gives owners the total of bills that will be due soon, which helps them figure out whether they need to contribute more money to the properties needing to pay bills.</p>

					</div>

					<h5 class="sub-title-2 mt-5">Transactions</h5>
					<p>Finally, the Transactions table offers detailed income, expense, contribution, and distribution entries, alongside bill attachments for enhanced transparency.</p>

					<div class="row ux-img">
						
				  		<div class="mb-lg-4 col-md-8 col-lg-9"><img src="photos/uiux/apm/txn-table.png"></div>
						<div class="pt-2 pt-md-3 mb-lg-4 col-md-4 col-lg-3"><p class="figure-caption">The running balance gives owners a quick and easy way to follow along the transactions and be assured that the ending amount is accurate.<br>
						Expense entries also come with bill attachments that provide extra details.</p>

						</div>
				
					</div>


					<h5 class="sub-title-2 mt-5">Ease of Access</h5>
					<p>Recognizing that 30% of our owner users access the portal on mobile devices, we wanted to make sure that this page, like all others in the portal, is responsive and easy to use on smaller viewports.</p>
					<div class="row ux-img">

					<h2 class="title mt-5 mb-4">Implementation & Takeaways</h2>
					<p>The feature is set for release in Q2 2024, aiming to streamline owner-manager communication and empower owners with real-time financial insights.</p>

					<p>Throughout this process, we encountered various challenges in aligning the Transactions page with the long-existing Owner Statement, encompassing technical intricacies and usability concerns. In addressing these obstacles, we learned valuable insights to inform future endeavors, including::
</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Continuously leveraging discovery processes to validate assumptions and fortify insights through user feedback.</p></li>
						<li><p>Ensuring the development of scalable features that seamlessly integrate with the broader AppFolio ecosystem.</p></li>
						<li><p>Recognizing the significance of including both property managers and owners in discovery research. As primary clients of AppFolio, property managers may possess distinct needs that necessitate consideration during research phases to avoid oversight.</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Overall, this project not only improved the Owner Portal but also enriched our approach to user-centric design and collaborative problem-solving.</p>
