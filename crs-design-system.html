					<h2 class="title mt-5 mb-4">Background</h2>
					
					<p>The <b>Library of Congress</b> is the oldest federal cultural institution in the United States. Its collections include millions of books, recordings, photographs, newspapers, maps, and manuscripts. One of the library’s missions is to research inquiries made by members of Congress, which is carried out through the <b>Congressional Research Service</b> (CRS), a public policy research institute of the United States Congress. Operating within the Library of Congress, it works primarily and directly for members of Congress and their committees and staff on a confidential, nonpartisan basis.
					</p>
					
					<p class="">The Library of Congress is redesigning CRS.gov. As part of that process, they need to develop a Design System in Figma based on the CRS brand and the USWDS guidelines.* The design system would then be used to create high-fidelity mockups of key CRS.gov pages.</p>

					<p><i>* USWDS (U.S. Web Design System) is a toolkit of principles, guidance, and code that makes it easier to build accessible, mobile-friendly government websites.</i></p>

					<p class="mb-5">To help LOC achieve this objective, our team worked on creating a detailed design system together with documentation. In addition, the team utilized the design system to create mockups of specific CRS pages and validate the design decisions through user research and evaluation.</p>

					<h2 class="title mt-5 mb-4">Process</h2>
					<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Adapting the design sprint</h4>
					<p>For this project, we took the <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/"></a>Google Design Sprint</a> framework, which is originally “a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers.” It consists of 5 stages corresponding to 5 weekdays: <b>map, sketch, decide, prototype, and test</b>.</p>

					<p>To properly use the Design Sprint within the constraint of our course schedule, we adapted the framework into a 4-week process, in which the sketch and decide phases are condensed. Throughout this entire project, we conducted a total of 3 sprints.</p>

	
					<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Discovery</h4>
					<p>We first tried to understand the problem by interviewing stakeholders from LOC who have deep insights into CRS.gov. During the interviews, we discussed the challenges with CRS.gov’s current design, the state of the overall design process, and relevant constraints.</p>
					<p>From our interviews, we discovered patterns related to the challenges with the current CRS.gov design:</p>

					<ul style="color: #ccc;">
						<li><p>The current CRS.gov design is outdated and doesn’t meet contemporary web design best practices.</p></li>
						<li><p>The new CRS.gov design needs to follow the USWDS guidelines.
</p></li>
						<li><p>The dense and complex information provided on CRS.gov needs to be presented in a readable and discoverable way.</p></li>
						<li><p>CRS.gov needs to convey a sense of high-quality service to its Congressional users.</p></li>
					</ul>

					<p>To understand the workflows surrounding a design system, we also interviewed 2 product designers and 1 front-end developer. We eventually created user journey maps for designer and developer personas to identify the major pain points as well as opportunities for the design system we were creating:</p>
					
					<div class="row ux-img justify-content-center">
						<div class="mb-4 col-lg-10"><img class="" src="photos/uiux/crs/journey-map-designer.jpeg"></div>
						<div class="mb-4 col-lg-10"><img class="" src="photos/uiux/crs/journey-map-developer.jpeg"></div>
					</div>

					<p>Based on the identified pain points, we developed opportunities that could be incorporated into our solution and voted on the most relevant points. For <b>designers</b>, we decided to focus on the following:</p>

					<ul style="color: #f9c0c0; font-size: 1.25rem">
						<li><p>Provide clear design principles with easily understandable wordings and a coherent structure to follow</p></li>
						<li><p>Offer more flexibility for designers when using the design system by providing alternative options and encouraging readers to use discretion when needed (research on examples)
</p></li>
						<li><p>Clearly state different use cases of components and patterns in the documentation</p></li>
					</ul>

					<p>For <b>developers</b>, we narrowed the opportunities down to:</p>
					<ul style="color: #f9c0c0; font-size: 1.25rem">
						<li><p>Create well-organized and easily readable documentation (e.g.: following alphabetical order, including table of contents)</p></li>
						<li><p>Make sure that documentation contains enough information about how/why/when to use components (include examples, do’s and don’ts)</p></li>
						<li><p>Maintain consistent organization in both Figma and Confluence that responds well to large amounts of new additions
</p></li>
					</ul>

					<p>Toward the end of the discovery process, with all of our findings from the steps taken, we identified the following goals that served as our north star throughout the project:</p>

					<ul style="color: #ccc; font-size: 1.25rem; font-style: italic;
}">
						<li><p class="text-call-out">Adapt the USWDS to the CRS brand in order to convey a sense of expertise through the CRS.gov design system</p></li>
						<li><p class="text-call-out">Create a design library in Figma that is organized and easy to navigate</p></li>
						<li><p class="text-call-out">Provide clear guidelines and relevant resources while ensuring readability in the design system documentation
</p></li>
						<li><p class="text-call-out">Validate and refine design choices through thorough benchmarking and user research
</p></li>
					</ul>

					<h5 class="sub-title-2 mt-5 mb-4">Researching Other Solutions</h5>
					<p>We conducted a <b>comparative analysis</b> to look at services that are similar to CRS.gov in terms of mission or functionality to find inspiration for our solutions: AEI, Aspen Institute, Brookings, CATO, and The Heritage Foundation. From our research, the most valuable finding we got was that websites offering similar solutions to CRS.gov have a much more modern, clean look, which is characterized by <i>generous white space, contemporary typography, and high-quality images</i>.

</p>

					<div class="row ux-img">
						<div class="mb-4 col"><img class="" src="photos/uiux/crs/comparative-analysis.png"></div>
					</div>

					<p>To familiarize ourselves with design system best practices, we also looked at industry-standard systems such as the USWDS itself, Google Material Design, and Apple Human-Interface Guidelines. These explorations informed us on design system organization, usability recommendations, and accessibility guidelines.</p>

					<h5 class="sub-title-2 mt-5 mb-4">Designing & Documenting</h5>
					<p>To start working on the CRS.gov design system, we first conducted a UI inventory on the current CRS.gov website to identify all the reusable UI elements that need to be included in the design system.</p>
					<img class="img-fullwidth" src="photos/uiux/crs/ui-inventory.png">
					<img class="img-fullwidth" src="photos/uiux/crs/ui-inventory2.png">

					<p>We decided to work on the design components and patterns using <b>Figma</b> while documenting them in <b>Confluence</b>.</p>

					<ul style="color: #ccc;">
						<li><p>The Figma file houses the <b>design library</b> including typography styles, color palette, components, patterns, and templates.</p></li>
						<li><p>The Confluence space provides <b>documentation</b> on specs, usage, usability, and accessibility guidelines. These two living documents offer intuitive navigation and a clear presentation of information throughout the design system.
</p></li>
					</ul>

					<p>As we started building out the design system from the most basic elements to more complex ones, we frequently communicated with our client in order to get their feedback, while simultaneously conducting internal critique sessions to give each other pointers.</p>
					
					<!-- <p>
					After the design system has been substantially created, to showcase how can the design system being utilized and further evaluate it, we also created mockups for a few key pages on CRS.gov. These include the <i>One Topic</i> landing page, <i>Media</i> page, <i>Recent Reports</i> page, <i>Place a Request</i> form and <i>About CRS</i> page.</p> -->

					<!-- <p>During this process, our team collaborated by dividing the work into 2 parts: design (3 team members), and documentation (2 members). Within each sub-team, each individual is assigned specific components/patterns to work on. I myself was a member of the design subteam, primarily responsible for design and worked on items such as <i>typography, button, card, carousel, header, collection, event details, process list, search, and the Media page mockup</i>, among others.</p> -->

					<p>The final CRS design system is based on the following design principles:

</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-lg-4">
							<h5 class="sub-title-2 mt-5 mb-4">Usability</h5>
							<p>Promote ease-of-use across platforms and devices.

							<p>Enable users to identify and utilize available functionalities.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-4">
							<h5 class="sub-title-2 mt-5 mb-4">High-Quality Experience
		</h5>
							<p>Reflect CRS’s top quality service.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>For the <b>typography</b>, we chose EB Garamond and Public Sans, which are elegant, neutral and readable typefaces to reflect CRS’s prestige brand and allow for legibility of the dense information on CRS.gov:</p>
					<div class="row ux-img">
						<div class="col-12"><img class="" src="photos/uiux/crs/type.png">
						</div>
						
					</div>
				
					<p>The <b>color palette</b> was heavily inspired by the existing CRS brand. The primary and secondary colors stay mostly similar with the blue and yellow variants. We added accent and state colors to account for other digital use cases for the CRS.gov website.</p>

					<div class="row ux-img">
						<div class="col">
						<img class="" src="photos/uiux/crs/colors.png"></div>
					</div>

					<p>With the color palette, we initially got negative opinions on the secondary color, which was inspired by the original one in the CRS print-based brand guidelines. Understanding that this hue may not work well digitally, our team experimented with various hues in the same color realm, until we reached a final agreed-upon solution with the client.</p>
					
					<p>For optimal organization, the CRS design system consists of <b>2 parts</b>: a design library in Figma and the documentation in Confluence.</p>

					<p>In <b>Figma</b>, we organize the design library using a separate page for each item. We then list them under the 4 main categories: style guide, components, patterns, and templates. Within each category, we list the pages alphabetically to aid discoverability.</p>

					<div class="row ux-img">
						<div class="col-12">
						<img class="" src="photos/uiux/crs/figma2.png"></div>
						<div class="col-12 text-center"><p class="figure-caption">The Figma file is divided into pages that contain style guide elements, components, and patterns.</p></div>
					</div>
					<div class="row ux-img">
						<div class="col-12">
						<img class="" src="photos/uiux/crs/figma.png"></div>
						<div class="col-12 text-center"><p class="figure-caption">Each component or pattern has its own variants or states corresponding to different use cases.</p></div>
					</div>

					<p>In <b>Confluence</b>, the pages are organized similarly to Figma to allow for intuitive navigation:</p>
					
					<div class="row ux-img">
						<div class="col-12">
						<img class="" src="photos/uiux/crs/confluence-cover.png"></div>
						<div class="col-12 text-center"><p class="figure-caption">Users can navigate from page to page using the left-side panel, similar to the Figma design library.</p></div>
					</div>

					<div class="row ux-img">
						<div class="col-12">
						<img class="" src="photos/uiux/crs/confluence.png"></div>
						<div class="col-12 text-center"><p class="figure-caption">The Confluence documentation includes further explanation of the style guide, usability guidelines, and accessibility guidelines.</p></div>
					</div>

					<p>Each page features a table of contents with linked sections to help viewers quickly scan the information and find what they need. For the design illustrations, we decided to use a Figma viewer plugin, which shows an embedded Figma frame for each component/pattern exactly as it is in Figma. This way, when there are any updates on the Figma side, these items get automatically updated in Confluence to reflect the latest changes.</p>

					<!-- <p>With the finalized design system, we created <b>mockups</b> for the <i>One Topic</i> landing page, <i>Media</i> page, <i>Recent Reports</i> page, <i>Place a Request</i> form and <i>About CRS</i> page:</p> -->

					<h2 class="title mt-5 mb-4">Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this was a project full of design, usability and technical nuances. Due to various factors, we faced three main issues throughout the project, which gave us major learning opportunities:</p>
	
					<ul style="color: #ccc;">
						<li><p>With a Confluence free plan, it was challenging for us to properly format the page layout. As a result, some of the pages aren’t as organized as optimally as we would like to. Another issue we had with Confluence was that the embedded Figma frames don’t always accurately reflect the selected content, occasionally showing irrelevant surrounding assets. Moreover, Confluence pages with Figma frames often take time to load.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>Secondly, implementation is out of scope for this project, as none of us has professional programming experience. A design system would normally contain code snippets and relevant implementation guidelines for each component/pattern. However, we tried our best to set up the design system in a way that would allow for efficient addition of code elements in the future.</p></li>
						<li><p>Thirdly, within the time constraint, we didn’t have the chance to include a few important parts of the design system, which we are now planning as stretch goals to be accomplished by the CRS team in the future. For example, several interactive components are currently represented as separate static states without documentation on their transition styles. Additionally, the mockups we created are all for desktop, so future work on mobile versions would be needed to account for responsiveness.</p></li>
