							  			<h3 class="work-title">SiriusXM Online Cancelation (Work in Progress)</h3 class="work-title">
							  			<h4 class="title">The Problem</h4>
							  			<p>SiriusXM offers subscription-based radio services. Currently, the company is not letting customers cancel online. Subscribers have to cancel plans via phone calls.</p>
							  			<p>In November 2018, the digital experience team got an assignment to create an online cancelation flow to potentially offer an alternative way for customers to cancel their subscriptions. This posed as a challenge, since this flow was completely new to the SiriusXM website at the time.</p>
							  			<h4 class="title">My Role</h4>
							  			<p>As an intern on the Digital Experience team, I assisted Senior UX designers throughout all steps of the design process. So far, we have got through user research, brainstorming, wireframing, and user testing. My responsibilities have been extensively focused on conducting competitive analyses and creating wireframes.</p>
							  			<h4 class="title">The Process</h4>
							  			<h5 class="sub-title">Research</h5>
							  			<p>To kickstart the project, we obtained data about SiriusXM listeners and their experience with our cancelation process from our analytic teams. Thanks to this data, we were able to learn about our users and their pain points during the cancelation process.
							  			</p>
							  			<p>To get more insight into the online cancelation process, the team decided to start with a competitive analysis. I was tasked with comparing and contrasting the online cancelation flows of subscription-based services similar to that of SiriusXM. To do this, I explored the flows offered by services such as Netflix, Spotify, Hulu, Pandora, and Amazon Prime.</p>
							  			<img class="col-12 wireframe-img" src="photos/uiux/siriusxm-cancelation/netflix.png">
							  			<img class="col-12 wireframe-img" src="photos/uiux/siriusxm-cancelation/spotify.png">
							  			<img class="col-12 wireframe-img" src="photos/uiux/siriusxm-cancelation/hulu.png">
							  			<img class="col-12 wireframe-img" src="photos/uiux/siriusxm-cancelation/pandora.png">
							  			<img class="col-12 wireframe-img" src="photos/uiux/siriusxm-cancelation/amazon-prime.png">
							  			<p>The competitive analysis shed light on a lot of notable aspects present within a seemingly simple flow. From my research, I was able to deduce a few conclusions about the common themes as well as differences present across the different flows. A lot of services try to divert customers’ attention away from the cancelation option, instead introducing alternative actions such as switching plans, temporarily putting the subscription on hold, or staying to benefit from a downgrade offer. Meanwhile, some flows are more lengthy and complicated than others. These details show that there’s a certain balance that needs to be achieved in this type of flow. From a corporate perspective, a service generally wants to retain its customers. However, from a design perspective, the process also should not be too painstaking or lengthy for users. This made me realize that our goal was to achieve a balance somewhere between these two extremes.</p>
							  			<h5 class="sub-title">Brainstorming & Idea Development</h5>
							  			<p>Taking our learning from the research step, the team moved onto idea development, starting with brainstorming sessions. During these sessions, we incorporated data we already knew about our customers with examples we picked up from the researched cancel flows to devise our own cancelation process. The ideas got iterated a few times before two main concepts were chosen: a “plan switching” flow and a “reason picking” flow.</p>
							  			<h5 class="sub-title">Wireframing</h5>
							  			<p>In the plan switching flow, the process starts with a “Switch your plan” option, which takes users to a page where the primary action is to switch to an alternative plan. This flow aims to discreetly divert the user’s attention from cancelation to a change of service.</p>
							  			<img class="col-12 wireframe-img" src="photos/uiux/siriusxm-cancelation/switch-plan-d.png">
							  			<img class="col-6 wireframe-img" src="photos/uiux/siriusxm-cancelation/switch-plan-m.png">
							  			<p>In the reason picking flow, upon clicking on the option to cancel subscription, users are asked about their reasons to cancel, and presented with checkboxes laying out possible causes. Users have the option to pick one from the checkboxes, and subsequently presented with an alternative action or solution respective to the chosen reason.</p>
							  			<img class="col-12 wireframe-img" src="photos/uiux/siriusxm-cancelation/pick-reason-d.png">
							  			<img class="col-6 wireframe-img" src="photos/uiux/siriusxm-cancelation/pick-reason-m.png">
							  			<p>During both flows, eligible customers would be shown a downgrade offer when they are a step away from confirming cancelation. After cancelation is completed, the accounting landing page would have a pushdown banner notifying customers with their canceled subscription, end date of benefits, and a reminder that they can reactivate their service at anytime.</p>
							  			<h5 class="sub-title">Next Steps</h5>
							  			<p>Currently, we are in the process of testing out the proposed flows to get a deeper insight into how our customers would potentially react to these cancelation processes. After we get the test results ready and analyzed, we plan to move onto high-fidelity visual mockups/prototype and implementation.</p>

							  			<h3 class="work-title">T.A.G. Labs Learning Management System</h3 class="work-title">
							  			<h4 class="title">Overview</h4>
							  			<p>T.A.G. Labs is a non-profit organization based in Washington, DC, whose purpose is to help young people enhance their creative talents by developing computer games, mobile applications and websites. In 2018, T.A.G. started their online program, which called for the need of a learning management system (LMS). As a long-term collaborator with T.A.G., I helped the team create the design for this system.</p>
							  			<h4 class="title">My Role</h4>
							  			<p>Throughout this project, I worked closely with the T.A.G. Labs Web Design/Dev team. I was mainly responsible for conducting user research and creating wireframes as well as high-fidelity mockups for the design of the LMS.</p>
							  			<h4 class="title">The Process</h4>
							  			<h5 class="sub-title">Research</h5>
							  			<p>Knowing that our main users are students between the ages of 10 and 18, we developed personas accordingly so as to get a deeper insight into our target users’ needs. We also did various competitive analyses on similar online learning systems such as Codecademy, Lynda, Coursera, and Udemy. From these analyses, we were able to explore each systems’ strengths and shortcomings.
							  			</p>
							  			<p>Through our research, we were able to identify certain pain points during the online learning experience. In an online environment without direct guidance from instructors, students sometimes need extra assistance in keeping on track with course progress. In addition, online learning tools are often overwhelmed with content from numerous courses, which calls for a coherent navigation flow.</p>
							  			<h5 class="sub-title">Idea Development & Wireframing</h5>
							  			<p>With our findings, we eventually came up with the following main goals for the design of the LMS:</p>
										<ul>
									  		<li><p>Make it easy to browse the LMS content, sign up, and keep up with course progress.</p></li>
									  		<li><p>Display information in an orderly, comprehensible manner.</p></li>
									  		<li><p>Create an engaging interface.</p></li>
										</ul>
							  			<p>
							  			Bearing the goals in mind, I built a navigation system that guides the user smoothly through different parts within the LMS and provides a satisfying learning experience. On the home landing page, the user is presented with 3 tabs for on-going courses, completed courses, and all courses, which features a search tool for easier browsing. These tabs provide an organized way for the user to keep track of their courses while browsing other available options.    
							  			</p>
							  			<img class="col-12" src="photos/uiux/tag/taglms-desktop-wireframes.jpg">
							  			<p>Each course’s landing page also includes 4 tabs, each of which displays one type of information about the program, so as not to overwhelm students with too many details. In the Curriculum tab, each lesson and its sections are displayed clearly. The sections’ different type of media like reading, assignment, or video are illustrated by different icons for easy recognition.</p>
							  			<img class="col-12" src="photos/uiux/tag/taglms-courselandingpage.jpg">
							  			<p>Along with the desktop wireframes, I also created a mobile version with similar navigation.</p>

							  			<h3 class="work-title">Veews</h3 class="work-title">
							  			<h4 class="title">Overview</h4>
							  			<p>Veews is a messaging application that’s being developed by a team of students from Howard University. Veews provides an optimized tool for college students to connect with one another and to their campus.<br>
										As the lead UI/UX designer of the project, I work closely with my teammates to research users, develop ideas and iterate UI/UX elements for the application.
										</p>
							  			<h4 class="title">The Process</h4>
							  			<h5 class="sub-title">Background & Research</h5>
							  			<p>Veews’ main objective is to create a unique digital experience for students to be connected to their campus community. Nowadays, college students in America, and in many other countries, constantly utilize technology for both their school and social life. Among the different types of technology they use, messaging apps serve as an important way to stay connected with peers and updated about relevant information. However, most of such apps were not created solely for college students, and therefore do not satisfy all of their needs and wants. This is where Veews steps in to cater a unique experience that’s specially crafted for campus connection.
							  			<br>
							  			Starting out, our team gathered information about our target users, who are college students in the US, mostly from 18 to 22 years old, and used to utilizing technology to handle tasks for both school and social life. Our users use group messaging, social media, and similar means almost every minute of a day, exchanging materials for a class, getting the latest updates on a school event, or joining a new student club. Knowing these behaviors, we began to form solid ideas of how Veews could provide a useful and fulfilling way for college students to stay connected within and beyond the campus.
							  			<br>
							  			We continued by studying messaging apps widely used by college students like GroupMe, WhatsApp, and Messenger. We compare these apps' features and objectives with those of Veews to determine what we could do to create a unique experience for Veews’ users. 
							  			</p>
							  			<h5>The Problem & the Solution</h5>
							  			<p>From our research, we narrowed down the biggest pain points within college students’ experience with messaging apps:</p>
							  			<ul>
							  				<li><p>Time-consuming process of creating group chats. Normally someone’s phone would be passed around a crowded classroom so that everyone can be added into the group.</p></li>
							  				<li><p>No organized way to browse a campus’s relevant groups. At our college, Howard University, as the school year starts, GroupMe groups would be overwhelmed with messages with the motif: “can you add me to the group of” plus the name of a course, dorm, or student organization.</p></li>
							  			</ul>
							  			<p>Knowing these problems, we then did brainstorming sessions and came up with the following main goals as an attempt to solve the above problems:</p>
							  			<ul>
							  				<li><p>Provide a coherent system that allows students to easily find and create essential messaging groups such as those for classes, residence halls, and student organizations.</p></li>
							  				<li><p>Keep students up to date with relevant campus updates.</p></li>
							  			</ul>
							  			<h5 class="sub-title">Wireframe & Iteration</h5>
							  			<p>To begin, I sketched rough wireframes from the ideas formed by our user research. Below is one of the early wireframe versions.</p>
							  			<img class="col-12" src="photos/uiux/views/views-wireframes.png">
							  			<p>After getting feedback from the team, I applied necessary changes to the wireframes, then moved on to create detailed mockups and rapid prototypes. Our team had several discussions on the mockups, as we discovered flaws of the designs and explored solutions to these problems. One major finding of these discussions was that the design did not carry elements that have potentials to attract our target audience – college students. I then started making iterations of the mockups until our team agreed upon one design.</p>
							  			<p>
							  			As my teammates started implementing the initially approved design and created a prototype, we conducted a user testing session with Howard students. The session was significantly helpful in finding out shortcomings and limitations with the app’s features and navigation. From the test’s results, the team decided to add several changes to the app, one major of which was switching from a side menu to a bottom navigation bar as an effort to make the app’s main features more organized.</p>

								    <h3 class="work-title">DC Metro App Redesign</h3 class="work-title">
								    <h4 class="title">Overview</h4>
								    <p>Being a frequent commuter on public transportation in Washington, DC, I often encounter difficulties tracking buses and trains, whereas the DC public transportation isn’t often reliable. To deal with this problem, I have been using the app DC Metro, which has proved to be quite effective. However, I have noticed a lot of shortcomings which significantly reduce the app’s usability. The same applies to quite a few people I know, who also commute within the DMV area. Hence, I came up with the idea of redesigning the app to solve those problems.</p>
									  <h5 class="sub-title">The Challenge</h5>
									  <p>My goals for the project surround the aim to make the app DC Metro more useful, usable, and satisfying for the user. These goals include:</p>
									  <ul>
								  		<li><p>Create a better navigation.</p></li>
								  		<li><p>Elevate the visual interface.</p></li>
								  		<li><p>Make it faster and easier to use the DC metropolitan public transportation system.</p></li>
									  </ul>
									  <h5 class="sub-title">My Role</h5>
									  <p>Since this is a personal project for practicing purposes, I took on most of the major roles of the UX design process: researcher, visual designer, and prototyper.</p>
									  <h4 class="title">The Process</h4>
									  <h5 class="sub-title">Research</h5>
									  <p>I tested the existing DC Metro app with 5 participants, who are frequent commuters of the DMV public transportation system. During the tests, I asked questions that gave me insights of what obstacles the participants faced while trying to navigate the DC transportation system using the existing app.</p>
									  <p>From all the data collected from the tests, I created a list of challenges the participants faced while using the existing DC Metro app. Then, I picked out the most common challenges to focus on solving:</p>
									  <ul>
								  		<li><p>Lengthy process of obtaining desired real-time tracking</p></li>
								  		<li><p>Limitations of the trip planner feature</p></li>
									  </ul>

									  <h5 class="sub-title">User Testing &#38; Iteration</h5>
									  <p>Using the initial prototype, I tested with 5 participants, asking the same questions used during the preliminary research process, which focus on the obstacles the users may face while trying to complete a task related to commuting. From the answers, I was able to figure out the weaknesses of my solutions. Then, based on my findings, I reiterated on a few components of the prototype and finally reached a final version of the redesign.</p>

								    <!-- <h4 class="title">Overview</h4> -->
								    <p>During my time interning as a web design intern at EverFi, Inc., I had the chance to work on the redesign for Navient’s online financial education tool - Navient Path to Success. This redesign was an effort to keep up with Navient’s rebranding in 2017.</p>
								    <!-- <h4 class="title">The Process</h4> -->
								    <p>I started the project by studying the new Navient brand identity, taking into account the crucial elements of the brand. Based on the findings, I created wireframes and mockups, which were then reviewed by my team members. After presenting the final mockups and getting approved by Navient, we started development. The final product was a website that features a straightforward, coherent introduction to Navient’s learning tool and a style that’s consistent with the Navient brand.</p>

         							<h4 class="title">The Process</h4>
         							<p>As a beginner at web development at the time, before actually starting the project, I spent time working on improving my HTML/CSS and JavaScript knowledge. I also looked at various frameworks, and decided to proceed with Bootstrap, as this popular framework seemed to serve most of the project’s objectives.
									After finishing the information architecture and wireframes for the website, I moved onto rough mockups, and then implementation. There were various obstacles during the development phase, but by attempting to overcome these difficulties, I was able to obtain lots of new knowledge and get much more comfortable with web development.
